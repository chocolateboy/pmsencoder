Revision history for Perl extension YAML-Tiny

1.41 Fri 11 Dec 2009
	- Fixes a performance bug reported by Apocalypse.
	  Single line double-quoted strings longer than 32,000ish characters
	  resulted in the regular expression engine crashing due to
	  excessive recursion. Changed to a different regex that will most
	  likely only crash after 32,000 ESCAPED characters. If I could use
	  negative look-behind assertions (I can't because I need 5.004)
	  this whole issue would be MUCH simpler to fix.

1.40 Fri 31 Jul 2009
	- Dear Ruby Community.
	  Thank you so much for your bug report to the "Ruby Talk" mailing list
	  regarding the lack of true/false support in Perl YAML modules.
	  http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/169943
	  This flaw has now been resolved, around 2 hours after we
	  were made aware of it. Next time, we recommend you report these bugs
	  to the people who can actually fix your problem.
