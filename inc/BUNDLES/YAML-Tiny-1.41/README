NAME
    YAML::Tiny - Read/Write YAML files with as little code as possible

PREAMBLE
    The YAML specification is huge. Really, really huge. It contains all the
    functionality of XML, except with flexibility and choice, which makes it
    easier to read, but with a formal specification that is more complex
    than XML.

    The original pure-Perl implementation YAML costs just over 4 megabytes
    of memory to load. Just like with Windows .ini files (3 meg to load) and
    CSS (3.5 meg to load) the situation is just asking for a YAML::Tiny
    module, an incomplete but correct and usable subset of the
    functionality, in as little code as possible.

    Like the other "::Tiny" modules, YAML::Tiny will have no non-core
    dependencies, not require a compiler, and be back-compatible to at least
    perl 5.005_03, and ideally 5.004.

        $yaml->[0]->{section}->{Foo} = 'Not Bar!';     # Change a value
        delete $yaml->[0]->{section};                  # Delete a value or section
        
    # Add an entire document
        $yaml->[1] = [ 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ];
        
    # Save the file
        $yaml->write( 'file.conf' );

DESCRIPTION
    YAML::Tiny is a perl class for reading and writing YAML-style files,
    written with as little code as possible, reducing load time and memory
    overhead.

    Most of the time it is accepted that Perl applications use a lot of
    memory and modules. The ::Tiny family of modules is specifically
    intended to provide an ultralight and zero-dependency alternative to
    many more-thorough standard modules.

    This module is primarily for reading human-written files (like simple
    config files) and generating very simple human-readable files. Note that
    I said human-readable and not geek-readable. The sort of files that your
    average manager or secretary should be able to look at and make sense
    of.

    YAML::Tiny does not generate comments, it won't necesarily preserve the
    order of your hashes, and it will normalise if reading in and writing
    out again.

    It only supports a very basic subset of the full YAML specification.

    Usage is targetted at files like Perl's META.yml, for which a small and
    easily-embeddable module is extremely attractive.

    Features will only be added if they are human readable, and can be
    written in a few lines of code. Please don't be offended if your request
    is refused. Someone has to draw the line, and for YAML::Tiny that
    someone is me.

    If you need something with more power move up to YAML (4 megabytes of
    memory overhead) or YAML::Syck (275k, but requires libsyck and a C
    compiler).

    To restate, YAML::Tiny does not preserve your comments, whitespace, or
    the order of your YAML data. But it should round-trip from Perl
    structure to file and back again just fine.

YAML TINY SPECIFICATION
    This section of the documentation provides a specification for "YAML
    Tiny", a subset of the YAML specification.

    It is based on and described comparatively to the YAML 1.1 Working Draft
    2004-12-28 specification, located at
    <http://yaml.org/spec/current.html>.

    Terminology and chapter numbers are based on that specification.

  1. Introduction and Goals
    The purpose of the YAML Tiny specification is to describe a useful
    subset of the YAML specification that can be used for typical
    document-oriented uses such as configuration files and simple data
    structure dumps.

    Many specification elements that add flexibility or extensibility are
    intentionally removed, as is support for complex datastructures, class
    and object-orientation.

    In general, YAML Tiny targets only those data structures available in
    JSON, with the additional limitation that only simple keys are
    supported.

    As a result, all possible YAML Tiny documents should be able to be
    transformed into an equivalent JSON document, although the reverse is
    not necesarily true (but will be true in simple cases).

    As a result of these simplifications the YAML Tiny specification should
    be implementable in a relatively small amount of code in any language
    that supports Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE).

  2. Introduction
    YAML Tiny supports three data structures. These are scalars (in a
    variety of forms), block-form sequences and block-form mappings.
    Flow-style sequences and mappings are not supported, with some minor
    exceptions detailed later.

    The use of three dashes "---" to indicate the start of a new document is
    supported, and multiple documents per file/stream is allowed.

    Both line and inline comments are supported.

    Scalars are supported via the plain style, single quote and double
    quote, as well as literal-style and folded-style multi-line scalars.

    The use of tags is not supported.

    The use of anchors and aliases is not supported.

    The use of directives is supported only for the %YAML directive.

  3. Processing YAML Tiny Information
    Processes

    The YAML specification dictates three-phase serialization and
    three-phase deserialization.

    The YAML Tiny specification does not mandate any particular methodology
    or mechanism for parsing.

    Any compliant parser is only required to parse a single document at a
    time. The ability to support streaming documents is optional and most
    likely non-typical.

    Because anchors and aliases are not supported, the resulting
    representation graph is thus directed but (unlike the main YAML
    specification) acyclic.

    Circular references/pointers are not possible, and any YAML Tiny
    serializer detecting a circulars should error with an appropriate
    message.

    Presentation Stream

    YAML Tiny is notionally unicode, but support for unicode is required if
    the underlying language or system being used to implement a parser does
    not support Unicode. If unicode is encountered in this case an error
    should be returned.

    Loading Failure Points

    YAML Tiny parsers and emitters are not expected to recover from adapt to
    errors. The specific error modality of any implementation is not
    dictated (return codes, exceptions, etc) but is expected to be
    consistant.

  4. Syntax
    Character Set

    YAML Tiny streams are implemented primarily using the ASCII character
    set, although the use of Unicode inside strings is allowed if support by
    the implementation.

    Specific YAML Tiny encoded document types aiming for maximum
    compatibility should restrict themselves to ASCII.

    The escaping and unescaping of the 8-bit YAML escapes is required.

    The escaping and unescaping of 16-bit and 32-bit YAML escapes is not
    required.

    Indicator Characters

    Support for the "~" null/undefined indicator is required.

    Implementations may represent this as appropriate for the underlying
    language.

    Support for the "-" block sequence indicator is required.

    Support for the "?" mapping key indicator is not required.

    Support for the ":" mapping value indicator is required.

    Support for the "," flow collection indicator is not required.

    Support for the "[" flow sequence indicator is not required, with one
    exception (detailed below).

    Support for the "]" flow sequence indicator is not required, with one
    exception (detailed below).

    Support for the "{" flow mapping indicator is not required, with one
    exception (detailed below).

    Support for the "}" flow mapping indicator is not required, with one
    exception (detailed below).

    Support for the "#" comment indicator is required.

    Support for the "&" anchor indicator is not required.

    Support for the "*" alias indicator is not required.

    Support for the "!" tag indicator is not required.

    Support for the "|" literal block indicator is required.

    Support for the ">" folded block indicator is required.

    Support for the "'" single quote indicator is required.

    Support for the """ double quote indicator is required.

    Support for the "%" directive indicator is required, but only for the
    special case of a %YAML version directive before the "---" document
    header, or on the same line as the document header.

    For example:

      %YAML 1.1
      ---
      - A sequence with a single element

    Special Exception:

    To provide the ability to support empty sequences and mappings, support
    for the constructs [] (empty sequence) and {} (empty mapping) are
    required.

    For example,

      %YAML 1.1
      # A document consisting of only an empty mapping
      --- {}
      # A document consisting of only an empty sequence
      --- []
      # A document consisting of an empty mapping within a sequence
      - foo
      - {}
      - bar

    Syntax Primitives

    Other than the empty sequence and mapping cases described above, YAML
    Tiny supports only the indentation-based block-style group of contexts.

    All five scalar contexts are supported.

    Indentation spaces work as per the YAML specification in all cases.

    Comments work as per the YAML specification in all simple cases. Support
    for indented multi-line comments is not required.

    Seperation spaces work as per the YAML specification in all cases.

    YAML Tiny Character Stream

    The only directive supported by the YAML Tiny specification is the %YAML
    language/version identifier. Although detected, this directive will have
    no control over the parsing itself.

    The parser must recognise both the YAML 1.0 and YAML 1.1+ formatting of
    this directive (as well as the commented form, although no explicit code
    should be needed to deal with this case, being a comment anyway)

    That is, all of the following should be supported.

      --- #YAML:1.0
      - foo

      %YAML:1.0
      ---
      - foo

      % YAML 1.1
      ---
      - foo

    Support for the %TAG directive is not required.

    Support for additional directives is not required.

    Support for the document boundary marker "---" is required.

    Support for the document boundary market "..." is not required.

    If necesary, a document boundary should simply by indicated with a "---"
    marker, with not preceding "..." marker.

    Support for empty streams (containing no documents) is required.

    Support for implicit document starts is required.

    That is, the following must be equivalent.

     # Full form
     %YAML 1.1
     ---
     foo: bar

     # Implicit form
     foo: bar

    Nodes

    Support for nodes optional anchor and tag properties are not required.

    Support for node anchors is not required.

    Supprot for node tags is not required.

    Support for alias nodes is not required.

    Support for flow nodes is not required.

    Support for block nodes is required.

    Scalar Styles

    Support for all five scalar styles are required as per the YAML
    specification, although support for quoted scalars spanning more than
    one line is not required.

    Support for the chomping indicators on multi-line scalar styles is
    required.

    Collection Styles

    Support for block-style sequences is required.

    Support for flow-style sequences is not required.

    Support for block-style mappings is required.

    Support for flow-style mappings is not required.

    Both sequences and mappings should be able to be arbitrarily nested.

    Support for plain-style mapping keys is required.

    Support for quoted keys in mappings is not required.

    Support for "?"-indicated explicit keys is not required.

    Here endeth the specification.

  Additional Perl-Specific Notes
    For some Perl applications, it's important to know if you really have a
    number and not a string.

    That is, in some contexts is important that 3 the number is distinctive
    from "3" the string.

    Because even Perl itself is not trivially able to understand the
    difference (certainly without XS-based modules) Perl implementations of
    the YAML Tiny specification are not required to retain the
    distinctiveness of 3 vs "3".

METHODS
  new
    The constructor "new" creates and returns an empty "YAML::Tiny" object.

  read $filename
    The "read" constructor reads a YAML file, and returns a new "YAML::Tiny"
    object containing the contents of the file.

    Returns the object on success, or "undef" on error.

    When "read" fails, "YAML::Tiny" sets an error message internally you can
    recover via "YAML::Tiny->errstr". Although in some cases a failed "read"
    will also set the operating system error variable $!, not all errors do
    and you should not rely on using the $! variable.

  read_string $string;
    The "read_string" method takes as argument the contents of a YAML file
    (a YAML document) as a string and returns the "YAML::Tiny" object for
    it.

  write $filename
    The "write" method generates the file content for the properties, and
    writes it to disk to the filename specified.

    Returns true on success or "undef" on error.

  write_string
    Generates the file content for the object and returns it as a string.

  errstr
    When an error occurs, you can retrieve the error message either from the
    $YAML::Tiny::errstr variable, or using the "errstr()" method.

FUNCTIONS
    YAML::Tiny implements a number of functions to add compatibility with
    the YAML API. These should be a drop-in replacement, except that
    YAML::Tiny will not export functions by default, and so you will need to
    explicitly import the functions.

  Dump
      my $string = Dump(list-of-Perl-data-structures);

    Turn Perl data into YAML. This function works very much like
    Data::Dumper::Dumper().

    It takes a list of Perl data strucures and dumps them into a serialized
    form.

    It returns a string containing the YAML stream.

    The structures can be references or plain scalars.

  Load
      my @documents = Load(string-containing-a-YAML-stream);

    Turn YAML into Perl data. This is the opposite of Dump.

    Just like Storable's thaw() function or the eval() function in relation
    to Data::Dumper.

    It parses a string containing a valid YAML stream into a list of Perl
    data structures.

  freeze() and thaw()
    Aliases to Dump() and Load() for Storable fans. This will also allow
    YAML::Tiny to be plugged directly into modules like POE.pm, that use the
    freeze/thaw API for internal serialization.

  DumpFile(filepath, list)
    Writes the YAML stream to a file instead of just returning a string.

  LoadFile(filepath)
    Reads the YAML stream from a file instead of a string.
