      $home    = File::HomeDir->users_home('foo');
      $desktop = File::HomeDir->users_desktop('foo');
      $docs    = File::HomeDir->users_documents('foo');

  # Legacy Interfaces
      print "My dir is ", home(), " and root's is ", home('root'), "\n";
      print "My dir is $~{''} and root's is $~{root}\n";
      # These both print the same thing, something like:
      #  "My dir is /home/user/mojo and root's is /"

DESCRIPTION
    File::HomeDir is a module for dealing with issues relating to the
    location of directories that are "owned" by a user, primarily your user,
    and to solve these issues consistently across a wide variety of
    platforms.

    Thus, a single API is presented that can find your resources on any
    platform.

    This module provides two main interfaces.

    The first is a modern File::Spec-style interface with a consistent OO
    API and different implementation modules to support various platforms.
    You are strongly recommended to use this interface.

    The second interface is for legacy support of the original 0.07
    interface that exported a "home()" function by default and tied the "%~"
    variable.

    It is generally not recommended that you use this interface, but due to
    back-compatibility reasons they will remain supported until at least
    2010.

    After this date, the home() function will remain, but we will consider
    deprecating the (namespace-polluting) "%~" tied hash, to be removed by
    2015 (maintaining the general Perl convention of a 10 year support
    period for legacy APIs potentially or actually in common use).

  Platform Neutrality
    In the Unix world, many different types of data can be mixed together in
    your home directory (although on some Unix platforms this is no longer
    the case, particularly for "desktop"-oriented platforms).

    On some non-Unix platforms, seperate directories are allocated for
    different types of data and have been for a long time.

    When writing applications on top of File::HomeDir, you should thus
    always try to use the most specific method you can. User documents
    should be saved in "my_documents", data that supports an application but
    isn't normally editing by the user directory should go into "my_data".

    On platforms that do not make any distinction, all these different
    methods will harmlessly degrade to the main home directory, but on
    platforms that care File::HomeDir will always try to Do The Right
    Thing(tm).

METHODS
    Two types of methods are provided. The "my_method" series of methods for
    finding resources for the current user, and the "users_method" (read as
    "user's method") series for finding resources for arbitrary users.

    This split is necesary, as on most platforms it is much easier to find
    information about the current user compared to other users, and indeed
    on a number you cannot find out information such as "users_desktop" at
    all, due to security restrictions.

    All methods will double check (using a "-d" test) that a directory
    actually exists before returning it, so you may trust in the values that
    are returned (subject to the usual caveats of race conditions of
    directories being deleted at the moment between a directory being
    returned and you using it).

    However, because in some cases platforms may not support the concept of
    home directories at all, any method may return "undef" (both in scalar
    and list context) to indicate that there is no matching directory on the
    system.

    For example, most untrusted 'nobody'-type users do not have a home
    directory. So any modules that are used in a CGI application that at
    some level of recursion use your code, will result in calls to
    File::HomeDir returning undef, even for a basic home() call.

  my_home
    The "my_home" method takes no arguments and returns the main
    home/profile directory for the current user.

    If the distinction is important to you, the term "current" refers to the
    real user, and not the effective user.

    This is also the case for all of the other "my" methods.

    Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if the current user does
    not have a home directory, or dies on error.

  my_desktop
    The "my_desktop" method takes no arguments and returns the "desktop"
    directory for the current user.

    Due to the diversity and complexity of implementions required to deal
    with implementing the required functionality fully and completely, for
    the moment "my_desktop" is not going to be implemented.

    That said, I am extremely interested in code to implement "my_desktop"
    on Unix, as long as it is capable of dealing (as the Windows
    implementation does) with internationalisation. It should also avoid
    false positive results by making sure it only returns the appropriate
    directories for the appropriate platforms.

    Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if the current user does
    not have a desktop directory, or dies on error.

  my_documents
    The "my_documents" method takes no arguments and returns the directory
    (for the current user) where the user's documents are stored.

    Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if the current user does
    not have a documents directory, or dies on error.

  my_music
    The "my_music" method takes no arguments and returns the directory where
    the current user's music is stored.

    No bias is made to any particular music type or music program, rather
    the concept of a directory to hold the user's music is made at the level
    of the underlying operating system or (at least) desktop environment.

    Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if the current user does
    not have a suitable directory, or dies on error.

  my_pictures
    The "my_pictures" method takes no arguments and returns the directory
    where the current user's pictures are stored.

    No bias is made to any particular picture type or picture program,
    rather the concept of a directory to hold the user's pictures is made at
    the level of the underlying operating system or (at least) desktop
    environment.

    Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if the current user does
    not have a suitable directory, or dies on error.

  my_videos
    The "my_videos" method takes no arguments and returns the directory
    where the current user's videos are stored.

    No bias is made to any particular video type or video program, rather
    the concept of a directory to hold the user's videos is made at the
    level of the underlying operating system or (at least) desktop
    environment.

    Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if the current user does
    not have a suitable directory, or dies on error.

  my_data
    The "my_data" method takes no arguments and returns the directory where
    local applications should stored their internal data for the current
    user.

    Generally an application would create a subdirectory such as ".foo",
    beneath this directory, and store its data there. By creating your
    directory this way, you get an accurate result on the maximum number of
    platforms.

    For example, on Unix you get "~/.foo" and on Win32 you get "~/Local
    Settings/Application Data/.foo"

    Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if the current user does
    not have a data directory, or dies on error.

  users_home
      $home = File::HomeDir->users_home('foo');

    The "users_home" method takes a single param and is used to locate the
    parent home/profile directory for an identified user on the system.

    While most of the time this identifier would be some form of user name,
    it is permitted to vary per-platform to support user ids or UUIDs as
    applicable for that platform.

    Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if that user does not
    have a home directory, or dies on error.

  users_documents
      $docs = File::HomeDir->users_documents('foo');

    Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if that user does not
    have a documents directory, or dies on error.

  users_data
      $data = File::HomeDir->users_data('foo');

    Returns the directory path as a string, "undef" if that user does not
    have a data directory, or dies on error.

FUNCTIONS
  home
      use File::HomeDir;
      $home = home();
      $home = home('foo');
      $home = File::HomeDir::home();
      $home = File::HomeDir::home('foo');

    The "home" function is exported by default and is provided for
    compatibility with legacy applications. In new applications, you should
    use the newer method-based interface above.

    Returns the directory path to a named user's home/profile directory.

    If provided no param, returns the directory path to the current user's
    home/profile directory.

TIED INTERFACE
  %~
      $home = $~{""};
      $home = $~{undef};
      $home = $~{$user};
      $home = $~{username};
      print "... $~{''} ...";
      print "... $~{$user} ...";
      print "... $~{username} ...";

    This calls "home($user)" or "home('username')" -- except that if you ask
    for $~{some_user} and there is no such user, it will die.

    Note that this is especially useful in double-quotish strings, like:

         print "Jojo's .newsrc is ", -s "$~{jojo}/.newsrc", "b long!\n";
          # (helpfully dies if there is no user 'jojo')

    If you want to avoid the fatal errors, first test the value of
    "home('jojo')", which will return undef (instead of dying) in case of
    there being no such user.

    Note, however, that if the hash key is "" or undef (whether thru being a
    literal "", or a scalar whose value is empty-string or undef), then this
    returns zero-argument "home()", i.e., your home directory:

    Further, please note that because the "%~" hash compulsorily modifies a
    hash outside of it's namespace, and presents an overly simplistic
    approach to home directories, it is likely to ultimately be removed.

    The interface is currently expected to be formally deprecated from 2010
    (but no earlier) and removed from 2015 (but no earlier). If very heavy
    use is found in the wild, these plans may be pushed back.

TO DO
    *   Become generally clearer on situations in which a user might not
        have a particular resource.

    *   Add more granularity to Unix, and add support to VMS and other
        esoteric platforms, so we can consider going core.

    *   Add consistent support for users_* methods

SUPPORT

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    The biggest acknowledgement must go to Chris Nandor, who wielded his
    legendary Mac-fu and turned my initial fairly ordinary Darwin
    implementation into something that actually worked properly everywhere,
    and then donated a Mac OS X license to allow it to be maintained
    properly.
